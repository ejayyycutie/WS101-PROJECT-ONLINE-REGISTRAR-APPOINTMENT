J. P. Rizal, Catarman, Northern Samar, was established in 1949 and incorporated in 1950 in response to the clamor for a school that could meet the needs of a particular segment of the town populace. At that time, there were only two schools in town; one was a private Roman Catholic high school; another, a public agricultural school about three kilometers away from the town proper across the river. There was no bridge then connecting the town to the road going that way and it was accessible only by banca. Public buses were scarce and tricycles and pedicabs were non-existent by then. A student from town had to hike the distance after crossing the river.</p></div>
